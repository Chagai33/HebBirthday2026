**Critical Project Directives:**

**Part 1: UI, Design, and Tech Stack**

1.  **Design Quality:** For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.
2.  **Allowed Tech Stack:** By default, this template supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, React hooks, and Lucide React for icons.
3.  **Package Restrictions:** Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc., unless absolutely necessary or I explicitly request them.
4.  **Logos:** Use icons from `lucide-react` for logos.

**Part 2: Backend and Data (Strictly Firebase)**

1.  **Exclusive Backend:** Our backend stack is based **exclusively on Firebase**.
2.  **Authentication:** All authentication solutions (user login, signup, user management) must be based **only on Firebase Authentication**.
3.  **Database:** All database operations (saving, retrieving, updating, deleting data) must be based **only on Firebase services** (such as Firestore or Realtime Database).
4.  **Storage:** All file storage solutions must be based **only on Firebase Storage**.

**Strict Prohibition (CRITICAL):**
Never suggest, recommend, or attempt to implement solutions that use Bolt AI's built-in DB or Auth services. Your permanent assumption is that the project does not use them at all, and all development is done **only** against Firebase.
