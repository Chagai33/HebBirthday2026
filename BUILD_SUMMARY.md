## 🎯 Key Features

### 1. Multi-Tenancy
Users can belong to multiple families/groups (tenants) and switch between them seamlessly. Each tenant has its own isolated data.

### 2. Hebrew Date Calculation
Automatic conversion of Gregorian to Hebrew dates using Hebcal API. Calculates next 10 years of Hebrew birthdays automatically.

### 3. Smart Verification
Duplicate detection, sunset time clarification, and gender selection modals ensure data accuracy.

### 4. Internationalization
Full support for Hebrew (RTL) and English with easy language switching.

### 5. Google Calendar Export
One-click export to Google Calendar with Hebrew dates and automatic yearly recurrence.

### 6. Role-Based Access
Owner, admin, and member roles with appropriate permissions for each.

## ⚠️ What Still Needs Work

### High Priority (Backend Ready, Frontend Needed)
1. **Phone Authentication UI** - Backend fully implemented, needs frontend forms
2. **Tenant Invitation System** - Backend ready, needs invitation UI
3. **User Profile Page** - Edit profile, manage linked accounts

### Medium Priority
4. **Email Notifications** - Birthday reminders via email
5. **Import/Export** - CSV import/export functionality
6. **Advanced Filtering** - By month, age range, etc.

### Nice to Have
7. **Dark Mode** - Theme switching
8. **Statistics Dashboard** - Charts and analytics
9. **Mobile App** - React Native version

See [FEATURES_TODO.md](./FEATURES_TODO.md) for complete roadmap.
